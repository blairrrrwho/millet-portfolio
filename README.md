# portfolio-blair

## Description
This is the creation of my first portfolio, which will be gradually transforming into a professional portfolio for future employers to see.
My main goal here was to get in a little About Me section to introduce the website. My second goal was to create the beginning outline for my portfolio. The creating of this webpage will serve the purpose of having my future professional webpage already built and just using it as a skeleton to add to for the future. 
I learned more about the process of form, and how to add and flex things as they need. A main thing I learned was how to build a website with a mobile-first design. 
That's what I've done here -- created the webpage with a mobile-first design and added media queries where the webage broke in ways I did not want it to. 
I'm still struggling a bit with the flex containers and how to utilize units that flex instead of just pixels that don't. 
It's a work in progress and will have many more developments in the future! 

## Table of Contents
1. Welcome Page
2. About Me
3. Projects
4. Contact

## Usage
Future employers will be able to utilize this webpage for a project reference and a skills guide -- it will display the current apps I've developed and showcase the skills I've gained along the way. Each app will be clickable and bring you to the app, and the future skills page will explain the current skills I've mastered and those in progress. 
Finally, they will be able to contact me in various ways as shown as the bottom of the page.

## Credits
I'd like to thank my classmates -- Christina Hall, Lacey Angarita, Brian Lucy, and Brandon Thompson -- for there collaborative opinions and debugging they did to help with the development of this webpage. 
I also used this tutorial for a little bit of guidance with the flex process for the project section:
